# isc-dhcpd-process-check
Simple script to look for the dhcpd process and restart it if it has failed.

This was created in a 2 server failover ISC DHCP environment where 1 server would regularly have the dhcpd process die.

I am not a programmer, but perhaps this simple script will save someone some time and/or downtime.
